      description: `In this phase, we define the project vision and core principles while assembling the technical and product teams. Feasibility studies on key technologies, such as local AI inference and unified cross-chain API scheduling, will be conducted. The initial whitepaper and architecture blueprint will be drafted, followed by the development of the first proof-of-concept prototype.`,

      title: "MVP Development & Testing ",
      description: `The MVP will focus on building a local AI agent capable of translating natural language into on-chain commands. It will support transfers and contract calls across major EVM chains and connect the Intelligence and Integration layers. We will also integrate a cross-chain protocol to enable cross-chain payments. A closed beta will be launched for developers and advisors to perform end-to-end testing.`,

      title: "Community Testing & Base Network Launch",
      description: `Early AI agent versions will be released for global trials (App, CLI, Web extension). A developer SDK will be launched to allow custom AI plugins. Additional chains and protocols will be integrated, aiming for 5+ chains, including privacy chains and Layer 2 networks. A basic incentive system will be introduced, and the plugin marketplace will be launched. Security audits of the models and wallet interactions will begin.`,
